# BunMask9000 User Guide & Manual

## Contents
Masks come shipped in packs of 1 or 2, in a roughly 4x6 inch padded envelope via USPS.

Packaged includes..
- the mask(s)
- a 42" shock-cord (bungee-cord, elastic-cord)
- a cord-lock (if available when shipped)

All contents have been handled with gloves + masks (N95, P100 respirator, or surgical) and the masks and cord have been washed in >140F degree water with detergent for ~20 minutes, then dried on high-heat. The detergent used was Arm & Hammer Free & Clear (for sensitive skin).

## Safely opening the package
Even with the extra care taken to sterilize the contents, with COVID is still on the prowl, you should do your best to open with care.

For those that are medically fragile, I'd recommend the following:
- Open the package up with gloves (or wash your hands after)
- Place the mask and cord directly in the washer on high-heat for ~20m w/skin-safe detergent.
- Hang or dry on high-heat (masks last longer if hung-dry)

For all others, you might just want to consider ironing the mask if it became wrinkled from transit. Normal cotton heat + steam is tested and it works fine.

Oh, and wash your hands!

## Preparing the mask

### The strap
>Originally, I had planned to offer the masks with either ear-loop elastic or shock/bungee-cord for "over the head and neck" style straps. Unfortunately, due to supply issues (as of writing this on 4/20/20), I've only been including the cord for over head & neck designs. *Fortunately*, if you don't like the way OH&N fits, you can cut down that cord into two smaller pieces and tie them to use as ear-loops (at whatever length fits you best). If this changes, I'll update the docs to reflect the change.

The masks come packed with a single 42" length of 1/8th inch (or smaller if available) shock-cord or bungee-cord and a cord-lock (if available).

The shock-cord needs to be threaded through the bottom of one side of the mask into the top of the other. If there were still any cord-locks left, I sent one with your mask(s). Thread the ends of the shock cord through the cord-lock then tie the end of it to keep the cord-lock from falling out. If your mask didn't come with a cord-lock, you can easily [tie a slip-knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/slip-knot) to fasten (and easily remove) the mask.

### Filters
Any non-woven (melt-blown) fabric or material works great for me as a filter. This section is a WIP, but I'll add a few examples of filter-materials I've used below. Make sure any fabric you use is breathable!

- Medical gauze or sponge material
- Coffee filter
- Paper napkin
- Tyvek or similar

## Wearing

### Putting it on and taking it off
Currently, I'm working on getting a use+care video together but, for now, I'd like to refer y'all to some of the better resources I've found online.

## Washing & Care

The following are guidelines I can recommend as a starting point but, ultimately, you should do some research yourself and decide what practice is best for you to ensure your safety.

Here's an article I found useful for setting my guidelines: [The Best Ways to Clean DIY Masks](https://www.popsci.com/story/diy/face-mask-sterilizing-sanitizing-guide/)

### Washing

#### Best
Try washing in 140F or higher temperatures. If your water heater is set lower, try using longer cycles at 120F.

- Wash in 140F+ temperature water w/ skin-safe detergent for >20 minutes
- Hang-dry somewhere clean or dry on high-heat for ~20 minutes


#### Alternate
Boiling is also an option, but it will significantly decrease the life-span of DIY masks.
- Boil with or w/o detergent for 5 minutes tops

You can also iron and steam the masks after cleaning, if they come out wrinkled.
- Iron on cotton/high head with steam

If, after washing or boiling, you still want to make sure the mask is clean, you can set it aside in a safe spot at room temperature (or warmer) for a few days.
- As an extra precaution, you can place masks in clean paper or plastic bag and set aside for 3-7 days after washing and drying.
